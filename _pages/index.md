# About

I completed a Ph.D. in computational biology at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/), the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)](https://www.embl.org/), and Heidelberg University, under the supervision of [Oliver Stegle](https://steglelab.org/) and [Michael Boutros](https://www.dkfz.de/en/signaling/). I am currently continuing my work there as a postdoctoral researcher.

Previously, I earned an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. in Molecular Biotechnology at Heidelberg University, Germany. During my studies, I gained practical experience through various research projects spanning neurobiology, machine learning and computer vision, optogenetics, synthetic biology, protein structure and interaction, and causal inference.

My current research focuses on developing high-throughput methods to investigate causal relationships between genotype and phenotype, uncovering gene regulation and function at scale. Beyond low-level processing of next-generation sequencing data, as well as analysis and visualization primarily in R and Python, I have applied a range of mathematical and computational methods, including probabilistic modeling, general machine learning, Bayesian deconvolution, empirical Bayes approaches, and the integration of high-dimensional data across modalities. Additionally, I have hands-on experience conducting single-cell experiments in the wet lab. Learn more about my research [here](/research/).

Outside of research, I enjoy dancing Swing and exploring nature with friends and family.
